# Instructions for Using GitHub Copilot in the Video Orchestrator Project

## Overview
This document provides guidelines and best practices for effectively using GitHub Copilot within the Video Orchestrator project. Following these instructions will help ensure that the generated code aligns with the project's standards and requirements.

## Best Practices

### 1. Code Context
- Always provide sufficient context in comments or function signatures when requesting code suggestions. This helps Copilot generate more relevant and accurate code snippets.

### 2. Review Suggestions
- Carefully review all code suggestions provided by Copilot. Ensure that the generated code adheres to the project's coding standards and does not introduce any bugs or vulnerabilities.

### 3. Use Descriptive Comments
- Use descriptive comments to explain the purpose of complex code sections. This not only aids Copilot in generating better suggestions but also improves code readability for other developers.

### 4. Test Generated Code
- After integrating Copilot-generated code, run tests to verify functionality. Ensure that unit tests cover new code paths and that integration tests validate interactions with other components.

### 5. Maintain Consistency
- Follow the existing coding style and conventions used in the project. This includes naming conventions, indentation, and file organization. Consistency improves maintainability and collaboration.

### 6. Document Changes
- Document any significant changes made to the codebase, especially if they involve Copilot-generated code. Use commit messages that follow the Conventional Commits format to provide clear context for future reference.

### 7. Provide Feedback
- If you encounter issues with Copilot's suggestions, provide feedback through the GitHub interface. This helps improve the tool's performance over time.

## Conclusion
By adhering to these guidelines, developers can leverage GitHub Copilot effectively within the Video Orchestrator project, enhancing productivity while maintaining code quality.
